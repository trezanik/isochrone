Byte sequence      Length     Starts
 description      in bytes    at byte    Value
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
chunk ID          4           0x00       The ASCII character string "RIFF"
size              4           0x04       The size of the wave file (number of bytes) less 8 (less the size of the "chunk ID" and the "size")
RIFF type ID      4           0x08       The ASCII character string "WAVE"
wave chunks       various     0x0C       Various chunks in the wave file as described below



                   Length       Starts at byte
Description       in bytes       in the chunk    Value
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
chunk ID          4             0x00             The ASCII character string "fmt " (note the space at the end)
size              4             0x04             The size of the format chunk (number of bytes) less 8 (less the "chunk ID" and the "size"). The usual size of the format chunk is 16, unless there are any extra format bytes (see below)
compression code  2             0x08             Various. A typical compression code is 1, signifying uncompressed Pulse Code Modulation (PCM). Other values are shown below
number of
 channels         2             0x0A             Various. The typical number of channels is 1 in mono waves and 2 in stereo waves
sampling rate     4             0x0C             Various. An example sampling rate is 44100 = 0x0000AC44 for 44,100 Hz
average bytes
 per second       4             0x10             Various. For example, a PCM wave file that has a sampling rate of 44100 Hz, 1 channel, and sampling resolution of 16 bits (2 bytes) per sample, will have an average number of bytes equal to 44100 * 2 * 1 = 88,200
block align       2             0x14             Various. For example, a PCM wave that has a sampling resolution of 16 bits (2 bytes) and has 2 channels will record a block of samples in 2 * 2 = 4 bytes
significant bits
 per sample       2             0x16             Various. These bytes define the sampling resolution of the file. A typical sampling resolution is 16 bits per sample, but could be anything greater than 1
number of extra
 format bytes     2             0x18             Various. These bytes define the number of extra format bytes to follow in the format chunk. This field may or may not be present
extra format
 bytes            various       0x1A             Various. These may or may not be present

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
chunk ID        4            0x00               The ASCII character string "fact"
size            4            0x04               The size of the fact chunk (number of bytes) less 8 (less the "chunk ID" and the "size")
data            4            0x08               Various information about the contents of the file, depending on the compression code
